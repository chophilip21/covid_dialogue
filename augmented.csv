"Hello doctor, I get a cough for the last few days, which is heavy during night times. No raise in temperature but feeling tired with no travel history. No contact with any Covid-19 persons. It has been four to five days and has drunk a lot of Benadryl and took Paracetamol too. Doctors have shut the OP so do not know what to do? Please help.
","Hello, I understand your concern. I just have a few more questions.
"
"Thank you doctor, I have phlegm but not a lot. A tiny amount comes out most of the time. I have no difficulty in breathing. No medical conditions and not a smoker nor a drinker.
","Hi, I would recommend you take n-acetylcysteine 200 mg powder dissolved in water three times a day. You may also nebulize using PNSS (saline nebulizer) three times a day. This will help the phlegm to come out. I would also recommend you take vitamin C 500 mg and zinc to boost your immune system. If symptoms persist, worsen or new onset of symptoms has been noted, further consult is advised.

"Hello doctor, I am suffering from coughing, throat infection from last week. At that time fever did not persist and also did not felt any chest pain. Two days later, I consulted with a doctor. He prescribed Cavidur 625, Montek LC, Ambrolite syrup and Betaline gargle solution. Since then throat infection improved and frequent cough also coming out. Coughing also improved remarkably though not completely. From yesterday onwards fever is occuring (maximum 100-degree Celcius). I have not come in touch with any foreign returned person nor went outside. In our state, there is no incidence of Covid-19. Please suggest what to do?
","Hello, I can understand your concern.
"
"Thank you doctor, After doing all these I can upload all for further query.
","Hi, yes, upload in this query only. I will see and revert to you.
"
"Thank you doctor, As per your guidelines, I have made one test. Due to city shutdown, I could not able to make an x-ray of chest. Fever is coming every 12 hours. But cough does not persist currently. The only problem is a fever. I am uploading the blood examination report. Please advice.
","Hi, I can understand your concern. I have gone through the report you have attached. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).
"
"Thank you doctor, How many tablets of Azithromycin to be taken? Is it in the morning? I want to make you know that I have already taken Azithromycin five days before. Should she start it? And also can I start an Iron tablet today itself?
","Hi, Yes, you can take iron tablet from today onwards. And no need for Azithromycin now as you have already taken it. Drink plenty of fluids orally and keep yourself hydrated. Do warm water gargles and steam inhalation four to five times a day.
"
"Hello doctor,
","Hi there, how can we help today?
"
"I am a 23-year-old man. I have anxiety and depression but no immunodeficiency disorders or chronic diseases. First, I wanna know if my immune system is weakened and how likely am I to die of Coronavirus.
","Hello. Anxiety can manifest itself in physical or psychological symptoms or both. The irritation sensation you are experiencing is a part of your anxiety. Also please do not believe the hype about covid. It has a low mortality rate, of 2-3 percent, that too mortality is very high in people above 60-70 years with other co-morbidities. You do not have any such disorders and you have not even been in contact with anyone, so do not worry.

"Hello doctor,
","Hello,
"
"Thank you doctor, I travel to school, nearby grocery stores in the bus. No airport exposure. I have not checked the temperature. I do not feel hot or anything. I have minor coughs and sore throat. Yes, I have mucus which seems white or clear for now.
","Hi, most probably with the history it does not appear like a severe problem or Coronavirus infection. Is sore throat severe and does the pain last the whole day? Do you smoke or drink?
"
"Thank you doctor, I woke up this morning, I had trouble sleeping being worried, but I got some sleep then nearby phone ringing woke me up.
","Hi, you have got it right. Follow all the precautions. You will be alright soon. Try getting a good sleep tonight.
"
"Thank you doctor, As of now 12:40 PM I am breathing harder than usual since 30 minutes ago. I only ate some breakfast and drank water.
","Hello, always Protonix is better than Zantac. Try using Protonix (Pantoprazole). Do not lie down immediately after consuming meals. Do not drink a lot of water after a meal. Avoid spicy and oily foods.
"
"Thank you doctor, I went to the store to look for Zantac they did not have it, so I talked to the pharmacy they said sounds like could be some weird chest tightening and the doctor said since Pepcid and Zantac are the same. He said to try Ranitidine.
","Hi, you need to take Pantoprazole or any other proton pump inhibitor. Avoid heavy meals. The issue appears like a heartburn problem due to acidity only. It does not appear sinister.
"
"Thank you doctor, I was trying to finish the bowl of food in one hour. I was eating veggies and rice, halfway through felt something like acid may be some pain in chest and throat. Feeling lightheaded so ate some meat to then coughed after.
","Hi, do not worry about it. Drink plenty of water but not immediately after a meal. Eat well cooked meats.
"
"Thank you doctor, I really appreciate your help so much. I appreciate your time and effort to help me and give advice. Only thing I am worried is just the chest pains, breathing issues and esophagus and throat stuff. I will try to wait two to three hours after eating or drinking before bed now. I hope to get less chest issues when I wake up.
","Hi, do not worry so much. You will be absolutely alright. Give it some time. If you are not getting better we can do laryngoscopy and check if there is anything wrong with the larynx. Do you eat healthy food and do exercises?
"
"Yeah if it doesn't get better Laryngoscopy would be perfect. Okay, I'll give it some time Thank you!
","I guess you are in the right track. With regards to food diet and exercise.
"
"Sounds good! Awesome! Appreciate your time and effort to help, this means a lot. Very patient and kind!
","First few cases were suspected to have spread from food. However human to human spread is mainly from air droplets.I would suggest you to refrain from swimming for sometime. Although the virus will get killed in swimming pool if it doesnot find host for more than few minutes. Other precautions include to avoid social gatherings, wash hands frequently with soap and water, cover face with mask, stay home during sickness, avoid travel.

"Hi, I am Chaitanya, 27 years old. I use to swim daily in morning. Does COVID-19 spreads through water ? What precautions should I take to avoid infection?
","Depends on severity. COVID-19 pandemic at this time, so a doctor on video may consult by video instead of requiring an in-person visit. Flu-like symptoms can be from a strep throat infection, a cold or influenza, or from some other cause like COVID-19. Usually, a person calls the doctor if the symptoms are bothersome, serious, recurrent, or persistent. COVID-19 testing depends on local availability.
"
"What is the treatment for Covid-19?
","Real vs. textbook. Real-life criteria is different because we don't have enough tests, supplies, or medical staff around the world at this time (March 2020). Textbook criteria are suspected COVID in hospitalized persons or in those with underlying medical conditions; or persons who got symptoms less than 14 days after (1) contact with a suspect or confirmed COVID patient or (2) travel through high-risk COVID area.
"
"Criteria for COVID test?
","Without any details it's impossible to say.
"
"I have covid 19 symptoms?
","Without any details it's impossible to say.
"
"Do I have covid 19?
","COVID-19 symptoms. Nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea occur fairly frequently early in the infection, but are rarely if ever the only symptoms. If cough and fever don't develop within a day or two after vomiting or diarrhea, probably it isn't COVID-19.
"
"Is vomiting and diarrhea a symptom of covid-19?
","Break. At 39 your risk for severe infections is very low. A strategy that I recommend is taking in information daily, but get away from it. Practice prudent precautions. In my off times away from ER (still practicing front line ER) I focus my mind on my cooking, planning my garden, engage with my friends and loved ones and read. 
"
"Anxiety because of the covid 19 news?
","CoV229e is one of several coronaviruses that cause common colds. Biologically related to SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19), but different viruses.

"Is the coronavirus 229E the same as covid-19?
","Seek care right away if difficulty breathing, other severe symptoms.
"
"Can I get a covid 19 test?
","your local doctor, local health department, we have no idea here what your set up is where you live.

"Where can I be tested for covid 19?
","COVID infections will likely pick up over the next few weeks in US. Avoiding travel and following hand washing recommendations are probably the most important prophylactic measures.
"
"Am I at risk for COVID-19 in the United States?
","Symptoms of COVID-19 are usually the same as a cold or the flu, with diarrhea being uncommon.

","In brief: COVID-19 and Asthma
"
"Is mild intermittent asthma an elevated risk group for Covid 19 complications? If so, should I continue to use my inhalers when it's occasionally necessary or will the steroids in them put me at more risk? Thank you.
","Being over 50 with a medical condition like intermittent asthma makes you at higher risk for any respiratory illness including COVID19.
"
"I read that people taking steroids for asthma are at higher risk for poor outcomes from COVID19. Does this include inhalers containing steroids? Also, is mild intermittent asthma a risk for poor outcomes or only more severe forms of asthma? Thanks
","People with chronic lung problems do worse in a lung disease outbreak.
"
"What symptoms would make you think I do not have COVID-19. I have a bad cold, but got diarrhea twice, so does diarrhea mean it is not COVID?
","Diarrhea does not rule out COVID.
"
"Can Covid-19 be transmitted sexually? Can any coronavirus be transmitted sexually?
","If you are having sex with someone who has Covid-19 you are quite at risk of getting it.
"
"Have read COVID-19 news quoting some experts as saying that we will see more confirmed cases as more tests are performed, but the mortality rate should drop as that happens. Any sign of that yet?
","Don't confuse actual mortality rate with REPORTED rate.

"Last tuesday I had a flu shot and a neumonia shot. I am 68 and male. I had a very sore arm and felt bad the next day in which I had blood drawn for a test. The results showed a high white cell blood count as well as high ANC and AMC. Could these high readings be because of the shots the day before?
","The pneumonia shot per se is not responsible for high WBC count, but as you are telling there are soreness and bad feeling at the injection site over arm, there are all possibilities that you have cellulitis or possible abscess formation at the injection site; which will recruit neutrophils at the site and cause secondary rise in WBC count.

"My father recently passed over the weekend. His body was fighting an infection along with pneumonia for 1 week. During that time, he would urinate bloody urine into the foley. The doctors said that was completely normal. It was very dark red. Is that normal?
","The pneumonia does not give rise to red urine called hematuria. There can be possible causes for red blood cells in the urine as uncontrolled urinary tract infection, kidney damage via systemic sepsis, abnormal clotting factors or platelet function, side effects of drugs, dehydration related issues.

"I was given amoxycillin for a chest infection and did not improve after 48 hours, therefore I went back to the GP who then gave me Clarythmomycin as it resulted in pneumonia. I have been off work for 3 weeks now and feel completely washed out and exhausted. I had a chest x-ray which was clear, but was given an inhaler temporarily as I was out of breath and wheezy. I still have an incredible amount of phlegm which has now changed from brown to sometimes green to clear. Unfortunately, for last 3 days, my trachea is extremely bruised to touch and feel as if someone is pressing my windpipe. Although my tonsils aren t swollen, my ear hurts deep inside. I have had to start taking paracetamol again this week as feel weak, wobbly and feel as if I am going backwards again instead of improving. I am 45 years old. Non-smoker.This is the 3rd time I have had pneumonia in 18 years. I am reasonably fit and healthy, and I don t suffer from colds normally, but whenever I come down with something, I seem to suffer with it. How long does it take to get back to normal? Are the trachea symptoms part of the initial pneumonia symptoms or would I need to see the GP again. I am feeling extremely fed up of generally feeling unwell. I am taking a tonic (Metatone) and drinking and eating healthily. Basically, is it normal to feel this unwell for so long.
","Yes, it might be that after the pneumonia the recovery time lasts up to one week however I recommend you to do a chest CT to see if the pneumonia has gone completely.

"I was diagnosed with pneumonia and pleurisy Friday 6/22/18.  Dr gave me Azithromiacin and 800mg of ibuprofen .  That was 4 days ago.  Azithromiacin has one pill left, and i no longer take the ibuprofen as not needed.  To date, I take Sudafed PE and Robitussin DM with expectorant & suppressant.  Every 4 hours when the meds wear off, my fever returns with body aches, chills, headache, and coughing. I continually cough up flem, and when lying down need to clear my throat every 30 seconds. I'm also bloated and get air bubbles under my ribs that are painful.
","As far as my clinical experience is concerned, the intensity of the symptoms are not under control with oral antibiotics. In our clinic, I recommend the patient to get hospital admission, start intravenous antibiotics, broncho dilators and other supportive measures to control the same.

"I ve had symptoms of cough, headache, stuffy nose, fatigue, and sore throat for 4 days. I know these are typical of common cold. However, once before (18 months ago), when I just tried to ride it out, I developed pneumonia and was in hospital for several days. Are there any precautions I can take now to prevent this from getting complicated? Thanks.
","Yes, you are right. If you don't pay attention in common cold, it can complicate as pneumonia. So follow these steps for better symptomatic relief in common cold. Drink plenty of fluids orally and keep yourself hydrated. Do warm water gargles and steam inhalation 4-5 times a day. Avoid cold foods like ice cream, cold drinks etc. Take treatment for common cold regularly. Watch for persistent fever, chest pain, Yellowish green expectoration, breathing difficulty etc. If any of these symptom appears then immediately get done chest x ray. Avoid smoking and alcohol if you have these habits.

"My sister, age 72, and living alone drove herself to an emergency room at 4:00 a.m. with temperature of 101+, chills and a little dizziness. They diagnosed her with pneumonia. She has COPD and uses inhalers and oral meds. I am concerned because she just told me she is extremely tired and has been under a lot of stress due to move from home of 45+ years, family concerns and loss of husband 2 years ago. She had hip replacement three months ago. I live an hour and a half away and am wondering if I should drive to her city and check on her. She does have a son and a neighbor friend looking in on her.
","She is already suffering from COPD (chronic obstructive Pulmonary disease). And pneumonia can be severe in already compromised lungs. So pneumonia in COPD patients should be treated promptly. And hence she needs hospital admission, Intravenous antibiotics, anti pyretic, Intravenous fluids and other supportive drugs. So better to admit her and start appropriate treatment.

"What is a right central pneumonia? My diagnostic x-ray report states there are hazy densities in the right perihilar and paracardiac areas; trachea is midline; cardiac sillhouette is not enlarged; hemidiaphragms, costophrenic, sulci and bony thoracic cage are unremarkable. I don t understand it.

"I have been on methadone for approx. 5 years now at a dose of 30mg taken 4 times daily. This has not only stopped any unpleasant withdrawl symptoms but has also offered considerable relief in easing chronic pain from a severe back injury 11 years ago. For the first 3 years of taking the medication I found that while it was effective in these areas their was an exceptional side effect in that it absolutely obliterated any interest in sex or even the ability to physically have sex. Also I found that I had next to no energy, making many things I used to enjoy fall by the wayside which in turn led to severe depression. After extensive talks with my Doctor I was sent for blood analysis and it was found that my level of testosterone was so low it barely registered. I was then put on a 3 week cycle of injections of 2mls of Delatestryl and for the past several years I have been the person that I used to be (it gave me my life back). Know I have been given a new Doctor at the clinic I attend and he has informed me that he is only there to prescribe methadone and will not be responsible for any other prescriptions. I do not have a family doctor and our emerg has said that this falls outside their domain. The walk in clinic treats every individual that I know so badly that their is no doubt in my mind that they will refuse to continue this presciption. (to give you some perspective on our walk in clinic - I went their several mnths back with sever pneumonia and the Doctor looked at my chart once and told me that I would get know %$# narcotics from him and to leave immediately) Any suggestions on how to get across to my knew methadone Doctor (who has only been in prescribing methadone for 2 months) just how much this would severely negatively impact my life?
","The pneumonia management depends upon the symptoms which are not narrated here precisely. The Methadone is known to cause long terms side effects over liver, kidney and other body systems, which should be discussed with the treating physician.

"I was given a steroid shot at 10am this morning when it was discovered that I have potential pneumonia. I was also proscribed an inhaler and a strong antibiotic, both of which I am now actively taking as directed. The Dr offered a cough syrup with codeine for assistance with sleeping through the symptoms that have been interfering with my ability to sleep, which I declined due to being someone who never takes medications at all and fear of having so much in my system at once. The Dr. clarified that Nyquil would be just fine if needed and if I m more comfortable with. I m having some anticipated potential insomnia from the steroid, and some heart palpitations, and I have an irregular heart palpitations to begin with. I feel inclined to take the Nyquil to ensure I get desperately needed sleep, but am concerned with all that is on board, etc. Definitive guidance would be so greatly appreciated, thank you in advance!

"Hello, I have had a chest infection about once a quarter for the last year and a half . I was diagnosed with asthma not long ago as well as having developed pneumonia for the first time in the past week. What could be causing such frequent illness? I have generally been a healthy person for all of my life. Sick maybe once every four years.
","Recurrent chest infections in asthma patients can cause bronchitis. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators (Formoterol or Salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (Budesonide or Fluticasone). Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

"How many tablets of Levofloxoacin would it take for a older person who is be told he is just coming down with pneumoria (he already has taken 4 pills & I am to give him another at 4 oclock, the reason I am asking this question is he had a fall & broke his hip but seem to have confusion & I had the doctor give him medicine for the confusion, but can not start it until he finish 6 more pill, thank you for any help you can give me.
","Levofloxacin is generally advised once a day. It's very effective for pneumonia. The dose is generally to be taken once a day for arrest 10 days.

","In my opinion, you should definitely consult pulmonologist for this pain. You will need a chest X-ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). A chest X-ray is needed to rule out recurrence of pneumonia because this can also cause similar kind of pain. PFT is needed to know the severity of asthma. You may need inhaled bronchodilators (Formoterol or Salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) (Budesonide or Fluticasone). Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

"I am recovering from pnuemonia. I was thinking that that I tore a muscle coughing but now I am beginning to wonder. On the right side of my chest, under my breast it hurts when I cough. It hurts when I press on it, but when I pinchthe muscles with my fingers I have no tenderness. It hurts as i go to touch my toes. Could I be having a problem with an organ under my ribs ? I have no pain on my left side.
","Pneumonia can cause pleurisy (inflammation of pleura) and this can cause similar kind of pain. So in my opinion, you should first get the chest X-ray done. If the chest X-ray is worsening, then your pain is due to pneumonia and you will need higher antibiotics. But if the chest X-ray is improving, then possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more likely. So apply warm water pad on the affected areas. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid sudden jerky movements of the chest. Take simple painkillers and muscle relaxant drugs like Ibuprofen and Thiocolchicoside. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query.

Is it dangerous for my mother, who seems to be recovering or has recovered from her pneumonia, to be placed in the same room as a patient with advanced pneumonia?
","Hello,To be honest, there is a chance of cross infection from one person to another. However, this depends on so many factors and most of the infections, especially bacterial pneumonia, do not transmit easily. If more than one arm distance, the chance is very little and if not too close (like kissing etc.) the chance is further reduced. If two of them are already on antibiotics, as in your case, there is a chance but in the setting what u described, it is extremely unlikely. Hope I have answered your query.

"My 80 year old wife is home recovering from pneumonia (double) twice in August. Her blood pressure has dropped to 82/44. How dangerous and how can I increase the level. Hospital sent her home with oral antibiotics the first time, no antibiotics the second time. She has been treated for this disease 4 times in past 12 months.
","Low blood pressure can be a serious and life-threatening problem. Is her blood pressure normally a lot higher than this? If so, then I would suggest urgent evaluation by a physician. Infections can lead to a response called sepsis, and part of this may include a drop in blood pressure, which can be dangerous to her organs. Ensuring adequate hydration is important, as dehydration can cause low blood pressure as well. If she is acting confused, fatigued, or more tired than usual then I would suggest urgent medical evaluation. I hope she feels better.

I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your daughter. Thanks.

"My husband (age 63 and in great health) was diagnosed with strep pneumonia and spent 3 days in the hospital, he was released with antibiotic Levaquin, after 5 days I had to bring him back to the ER because he spiked a fever of 101. They discovered that the original pneumonia of the right upper lung was almost gone but it had spread to the lower lobe. They discharged him with prescriptions for Azrithomycin 500 mg once a day for 7 days and Amox TR-K CLV 875-125 twice a day for 10 days. The Amox is making him very nauseated and he gets headaches from it. Can he stop taking it after 7 days instead of 10? Generally he is feeling better, no fever since beginning the two antibiotic combination?
","It will be better if he takes it for 10 days. In order to prevent from nausea and headache you cam give him combination of antacid with antiemetic i.e drugs like PANTOP D OR NUPENTA DSR OR GEMPRAZ DSR ONCE A DAY for the rest of the treatment period.

"I have been ill for 6 weeks and my GP suspected pneumonia and I was put on antibiotics.  The third one has almost cleared the infection.  However, I had an X-ray and it apparently showed nothing at all, although all my symptoms were in line with pneumonia and my GP had definitely heard a lot of crackles in the left lung.  Is it possible that I had pneumonia if the Xray was clear?
","Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. For diagnosis of pneumonia, chest x ray need to have infiltration.With normal chest x ray, pneumonia is not possible. Cough, congestion, crackles on auscultation are also seen with bronchitis. And bronchitis shows normal chest x ray too.So it is quite possible that you improve within antibiotic because antibiotics also work in bronchitis. So I don't think you are having pneumonia because your chest x ray is normal. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

","Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. If you are not having fever, cough or chest pain after completing antibiotics, you are probably cured from pneumonia.

"My friend had pneumonia a few weeks ago and was given cipro and flagl antibiotics.  She had to return to the hospital two more time because of spiking temperatures.  Fluid was tested from her lungs and came back negative.  Could she possibly have contacted mersa?
","Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Repeated spiking temperatures (fever) in pneumonia patient is suggestive of nonresolving pneumonia.So better to consult pulmonologist and get done sputum culture and sensitivity report.

"I am 33 years old, I was diagnosed with pneumonia almost a month ago after a short period of low grade fever and dry cough.

A chest CT was performed and found subsegmental consolidatory changes in the anterior and lateral basal segments of right lower lobe with bronchial wall thickening, minimal ground glass opacification in the adjacent posterior and medial basal segments, few small mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes, plus few lymph nodes seen in the pretracheal region, few of them showing dense calcification.My last lab report from december 23rd is as followsTOTAL COUNT-7200/cummNeutrophils-70%, Lymphocytes-28%, Eosinophils-2%ESR-28 mm/hr.Still I am having fatigue, dry cough and pains.

","Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Possibility of post infectious bronchitis is more likely. Bronchitis (inflammation of airways) is common after pneumonia.And persistent dry cough and chest pain are mostly due to bronchitis.So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only.

"NAME: Brent
","Thanks for your concern. The dry cough basically has a few causes....First is Post nasal drip, second  Gastroesophageal reflux'heart burn', third Cough variant aasthma, forth Heart failure and finally Interstitial lung disease. Based on the information if you don't have a heart burn or reflux of food or sour brash into your mouth, you are having a cough variant asthma, make sure you do not have difficulty breathing. There is something called cardiac asthma, but it's not much of a likelihood given your young age.I advice you that you give up on smoking as it causes a multitude of problems and may well be related to the cough you've been having now called as 'smokers cough'.It's time that you stop smoking, avoid animal dancers, mites, pollens and any thing that would exacerbate the illness, make sure you don't have a heart burn, and if still the cough persists , meet a pulmo neologism and get a Pulmonary function test with methacholine challenge

"Hello. About 3-4 weeks ago I was diagnosed with pneumonia. After two weeks I felt well enough to start getting back out, but I continued to cough up mucus. I got in the swimming pool last night and it was an outdoor pool and kind of cool. this morning I woke up with fever, wheezing bad and my back in my lung area hurts so bad. The coughing is getting worse too. Could the pneumonia have came back or never left? What should I do?

"A friend of mine has been treated for an, as yet unidentified, intestinal parasite with the antibiotic Levofloxacin. He was also diagnosed with a right lower lobe pneumonia discovered on CT scan. His physician told him that the antibiotic would take of both the pneumonia and the parasite. As a NP, I am familiar with Levaquin s use to combat pneumonia but the only antibiotics I can find for use as an antiparasitic are Tetracyline and Emycin if Metronidazole cannot be tolerated. Is Levofloxacin now also being used the way Emycin might be used in the absence of Flagyl?
","Respected user , HiWarm welcome to Healthcaremagic.comI have gone through your concern in depth .*  Levofloxacin is best effective molecule for pneumonia and many intestine    bugs .*  Metronidazole  may be kept reserved on waiting for certain test reports      or clinically physician may not need  to  add to the drug cart according     to the evaluation and clinical experience .Hope this clears your doubt .Regards .

"Son is 9 years old.  He has strep and is on amoxicilin.  His fever is gone now, but he still doesn't feel good.  Very tired and dark circles under the eyes.  Very pale.  He has been on the med for 3 full days and I think the antibiotic is not working.  Could he also have pneumonia (no cough though).
","Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.No need to worry for pneumonia as he is not having coughing.Coughing is first symptom of pneumonia.So pneumonia is unlikely in the absence of coughing.And 3 days antibiotic duration is too early to decide about effectiveness.You should give full 7 days course of amoxicillin.Fever was subsided so amoxicillin Island definitely working.Along within amoxicillin, give him plenty of fluids orally, fruits, juices etc for energy.Don't worry, he will be alright.Hope I have solved your query.

"hello doc.Im Gigi 51 yrs old previously i have ptb but the doctor told me that it was cured already 7 yrs ago every time i go to his clinic he told me i have a pneumonia after en x-ray result even though i told him that i spit w/ blood last monday i go to his clinic agin for a medical check up and he prescribed me cefuruxime kefstar i bought 9 pcs only and switch to another brand of cefuruxime Axetil after 4 days i spit mucus w/ blood as for now im suffering severe backpain what should i do thank you so much doc
","Hello Gigi !Coughing up blood with sputum (henoptysis) is a red flag sign .. meaning to say it definitely needs Medical attention . Considering you have had TB in the past there are many possibilities for your present episodes of hemoptysis.  It could me a bacterial infection or relapse of TB or post TB bronchiectasis (abnormal permanent dilation of your airways at few places which happens when they get damaged due to your past TB). Take a course of antibiotic as prescribed by your physician ,Consult with your physician  and discuss about taking drugs like tranexemic acid which reduce the bleeding tendency , cough suppressants . while sleeping, Lie on the side which was previously affected by TB and be on complete bed rest . Once your hemoptysis gets controlled go for sputum examination to check for TB bacilli , chest x ray and if needed HRCT thorax (to pick up bronchiectasis which can sometimes be not evident on x ray). Since u mentioned severe back pain , vascular abnormalities concerning  the descending aorta (the major blood vessel carrying blood from the heart)needs to be also considered  Treatment is to be decided based on the cause for your hemoptysis.Do review with your physician and get the necessary investigations done.

"Hi- I was diagnosed a month ago with community pneumonia. After two rounds of antibiotics I was feeling better. Now my cough is back and I have a strange heavy feeling especially in my legs. I have been exhausted too for the last few days. Could this be from pneumonia?
","Hello! Just because you have previously had a pneumonia does not necessarily mean this time too You will be having it again. Since how long have you been having cough ? Are you having a dry cough or produce phlegm ? what's the colour of the phlegm ? last time you had pneumonia was it properly n completely treated ? Apart from cough what are your other complaints at present ? your cough can be due to inflammation of your throat lining or it can be something to do with your lungs like previous time.  Kindly get your checked by a physician with an open mind and go for a Chest X ray if necessary.

","It sound like your cousin has something called- Empyema. It is basically an abscess in the chest cavity. And the correct treatment for it is drainage - which was done appropriatley. But he should receive antibiotic treatment with coverage of both aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Usually specimens are send from the procedure to see which organisms grow and provide a more directed antibiotic coverage.

","Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, her diarrhoea is mostly due to amoxicillin. Amoxicillin can cause diarrhea on second exposure. So you should stop amoxicillin. There are options for oral antibiotics other than amoxicillin like cefixime, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin etc. And left basal pneumonia means lung infection in lower lobe of left lung.

"What is the advisability of exercise in the year following treatment with Levofloxaxin for pneumonia? I just completed 5 days of treatment with pills after 4 or more days of IV in the hospital following gall bladder surgery. I entered the hospital with pneumonia (not knowing I had it), probably having contracted it from my brother who had it and whom I had visited several days earlier in another hospital. I am 71 years old, female; I had a non-heart damaging heart attack in 2003 and have tried to maintain a good exercise program to lessen my chances of worsening heart disease. Should I resume Naproxen for joint/muscle pain; had 2 doses (2 tablets twice daily) 2 days before hospitalization. Did not need it the 3rd day and was hospitalized the next day. Did not take it post hospitalization. Do not remember if they gave it in hospital; think not. Thank you.
","Hello welcome to HCM. I have gone through your history. You have been adequately treated for your pneumonia and I suppose you don't have any symptoms of pneumonia like cough, fast breathing, fever, breathlessness. Since you have received intravenous plus 5 days of oral antibiotics, now you can resume about your exercise regime. As you say you had a non damaging heart attack, means that your heart pumping function is well preserved. So you must not have any issues with exercise. With every lung infection the lung capacity decreases by some percentage proportional to he severity of the infection. Hence along with your routine exercises you must also undergo breathing exercises with incentive spirometry, inhaling deeply through one nose holding your breath and exhaling fully from the other nose, meditation and yoga. This will help you to regain some of the lost lung capacity. You should also get vaccinated with influenza and pneumonia vaccines that include common strains which cause pneumonia Remember they don't protect you against all pneumonias but offer protection against common pneumonias.Regarding Naproxen too much of it may cause damage to your kidneys so I advice you decrease its usage and use it only when required rather than a daily basis.Wishing you good health. Regards

I was up to without exaggeration, eating 240 10mg p s, 98 30mg oxycodone pills, as well as an assortment of 5mg pills which were always at my disposal. I have cancer and have severe back injuries but along with the p s I also had monthly access to 240 2mg xannax pills which after awhile Ihad no problem eating all of the above each month and would look for some more. I died 4 times in a 6 year span due to double pneumonia which the Dr.s told me my medications were playing a large roll in this. When I was 16 I became an atheist due to my brother dying, he was my favorite and I became very drug dependent to kill the pain.

","Respected user, hi I evalauted your query thoroughly.Sorry to hear about the issue.*Prognosis depends on many factors - age - associated comorbid conditions   like heart attack / cv stroke / kidney malfunctions / diabetes - immunity  - haemoglobin level - body response to treatment - competency of doctors  - efficacy of molecules used in treatment & much more list not possible to  narrate whole here.*Considering all your narrations, her prognosis is guarded, not that much  good as normal person suffering from pneumonia recovering in days. - She may take very long time for recovery & may not recover also ( I pray   to God that doesn`t happen ) after your long jugglery with all ventilator   period. - I can suggest to see the progress of the patient on ventilator for 5-7 days   discuss with the consultant in details regarding this & then decide to    continue the treatment or wean her off from ventilator for resting her   sole in peace. Hope this clears your query. Thanks for using Health care magic & keeping trust in our medical services Regards

"I was diagnosed with pneumonia 2 days ago at med express and was given a prescription for levoquin. I cough up clear phlegm. My research tells me I m being treated for bacterial pneumonia but the clear phlegm ,Indicates viral pneumonia. I m a 67 year old male who quit smoking last November.
","Hello sir,Seeing at your history would like to know more about your case.Want to look at your chest x ray first.and if its definitely diagnosed pnemonia, then in case you could be right that it could be viral pneumonia.but you can't stamp it as viral from clear phlegm. Get done white blood counts which will be within normal limits in case of viral and high in case of bacterial pneumonia. Also get done Procalcitonin and CRP level of your blood. it will give you final idea.And as you were smoker phlegm might be due to Bronchiectesis or COPD. rule out that.

"Yes I had pneumonia and now have Costochondritis. I am just wondering if it will ever go away. I am active and miss my workouts. Every time I try to start working out it comes back. Will I ever be able to work out again? It has been since April when I had pneumonia and I still am dealing with this. YYYY@YYYY
","Do you have diagnosed it correctly ? Go for HRCT CHEST , or Bronchoscopy for same. take i.v. antibiotics and then oral. complete course of antibiotics. For costochondritis apply analgesics ointment on it along with systemic anti inflammatory drugs. Get done diagnosis proper. You will definitely able to work again.

"I recently got over either the flu or pnemonia. I've noticed my feces are increasingly yellow or whitish. I had quit smoking thrity days ago and have been on the nicotine gum and now the lozenges. I don't feel bad, but this is unusual. Could the nicotine products be contributing to the discoloration? Thank you.

"My fiancé has been coughing uncontrollably every night for the past 4 months. He is 23 years old, 5'9"", about 140 lbs., and has been told by his dr that he has walking pneumonia. He has been prescribed antibiotics, cough syrup, allergy medicine, mucinex, nasal sprays, and inhalers and although they suppress the coughing at times he still does not seem to have gotten rid of the coughing. His coughing is accompanied with phlegm and has also caused him to throw up due to the extremity. He does smoke cigars as well. What is this!?
","Walking pneumonia is a non-medical term to describe a mild case of pneumonia. It is usually called atypical pneumonia because the disease is different from more serious cases of pneumonia caused by typical bacteria. it is often the result of a lung infection from a bacterial microorganism called Mycoplasma pneumoniae and generally treated with antibiotics. Mild infections are often not treated because they tend to clear on their own. With treatment, most people begin to feel better within a few days.

"How can one be sure of a diagnosis of pneumonia or pertusses in adults. How do you compare? My doc thinks I have pertusses. But the doctor in Mexico where I was originally treated said I had PB pneumonia. I was on intravenous antibiotics for three days in Mexico before coming home to my dr.here in L.A.The xrays showed lots of mucus in my lungs.  I am confused.  is there a definitive test for petusses in adults? Dr said I will be fine. Gave me ADVAIR and cough medicine and says I will be fine but will cough for a pretty long while until the lungs are clear.  He said I do not need antibiotics because I have already had zpack and 10 days of ampicillin, and then 3 days fo intravenous antibiotics. Who do I believe? I am 65 years old. never was feeling this sick or tired before or have had any kind of lung involvement in my life.  I am a strong healthy woman. No immune deficiency or anything like that.
","Respected Sir, hi. Diagnosis of Pertussis is clinical usually,divided into 3 stages .1st stage (catarrhal) where runny nose, sneezing, low grade fever, occasional cough. 2nd stage (paroxysmal) bursts of coughing or numerous rapid coughs, difficult to expel thick mucus from airways in lungs , long respiratory effort with high-pitch breath sound , individual may have cyanosis with or without vomiting during severe attack, inbetween attacks, patient becomes normal.3rd stage is convalescent or recovery gradually from above all. overall period may range from 1-2 weeks to 10-12 weeks.  In which cases diagnosis is not certain or require confirmation *Culture of bacterium Bordetella pertusis from nasal secretions *PCR test identifying genetic material from the bacterium in nasal secretions. Hope this clears your query dear madam, thanks regards take care, bye, wishing you fast speedy recovery from the same.

"Went to the doctor 3 weeks ago for possible exercise induced asthma due to chest pain. They have me a daily steriod inhaler and albuterol rescue inhaler. The did an xray as well and a few days later I found out I had pneumonia. I did a zpack for 5 days and now levaquin 500mg twice daily on day 7 or 10. Just last night I went to urgent they said I still have the pneumonia got a steroid injection and a medrol dose pack. Still getting worse...not sure what to do and the chest pain seems worse, and the levaquin has made my stomach very irritated which is expected. The steroids make sleeping impossible and I constantly feel overheated since the injections and dose pack I started yesterday.
","Hi and welcome in HCMAccording to the history this might be  a situation called *Nonresponding Pneumonia*It would be better to be hospitalized for further examinations like:CRPHemogramALT,ASTChest CT (if needed)ABGFor exploring better the situation and do the treatment in i/v route .If you have comorbidites they should be evaluated too.Sometimes when the other comorbidities are not well treated the pneumonia does not respond so well from the treatment.So please discuss with your doctor for the aboveRegardsDr.Jolanda
"
"I went to the doctor today and found out that I have pneumonia. I got a steroid injection and breathing treatment in the office and was sent home with levaquin, albuterol, and cough medicine. My forearms and legs are very tingly and almost numb and heavy feeling. Is this from the steroid injection? I am 23 years old and I have juvenile rheumatoid arthritis so I am also taking humira, methotrexate, plaquenil, and folic acid for the RA. Is this a side effect or a drug reaction or nothing to be concerned about?
","Tingling in extremities may be a sign of peripheral neuropathy, wich is most of the cases caused by inflammatory injury to the nerves. Anti-TNF drugs, such as Humira, have been reported to be associated to this kind of injury, that can be potentialized when associated to steroids. You should visit your attending rheumathologist for physical evaluation and apropriate management.

"My father is in the hospital on ventilator currently.  The doctor says he now has what is considered whiteout in his lungs.  He has said that the outline of the heart can no longer be seen.  My father aspirated and then was diagnosed with pneumonia.  Three days later he ended up in ccu on a ventilator and has not been able to be weened off/  He is currently taking 3 antibiotics.  What is your advise.
","Lung whiteout and loss of heart outline are findings of chest x-ray compatible with many abnormal conditions affecting the lungs, like pneumonia, pleural effusion, acute respiratory distress syndrome among others. In the actual setting, your father is already receiving treatment to his pneumonia. All the other possibilities are probably been considerated and adressed by CCU staff. Weaning from mechanical ventilation is sometimes challenging because many factors can impair patients evolution, like how long he's been in MV, his nutrition status, his cardiovascular performance and resolution of the cause that led him to MV in the first place.

"My husband, age 63 is feeling cool on his abdomen and back while the rest of him is warm...currently sleeping. Last week was diagnosed with pneumonia...had a period last week when he was so cold, couldn t get warm so we went to the hospital. He says he is feeling fine and feels OK to work everyday (does construction work outside on a normal basis). Should I be concerned tonight that part of him feels cool even when under covera for an hour or two Thanks so much
","Hello and thank you for asking in HCM I can understand your concern Don't worry so much. Your husband is under treatment for pneumonia according to the history and he has had fever several times.Now he feels better but he is not completely asymptomatic which means that the feeling he had might be due to an episode of temperature not so high .This shows that the treatment is doing well. But he has to be careful with the treatment to be correct as the doctor has prescribed ,no smoking and not to work in dust environment ,a lot of liquids too.Take careWish a fast recovery for your husband.

"Hi Dr. If all I have is a dry cough, should I get tested for covid 19? No recent travel or contact with high risk individuals. I have been given permission to visit a relative in ICU during the lockdown, but don't want to make him sick.

COVID testing is by nasal swab, but there's a shortage of test kits in this pandemic. Only local resources know local testing sites, times, restrictions. Even a negative test does not guarantee one does not have COVID-19. Safest for people to stay away from ICU patients.

","COVID-19? It sounds like your mom is in good hands. If she has COVID, they will know how to treat it. If the pneumonia is beleived to be bacterial, they will treat with antibiotics. There is no proved effective treatment for coronavirus itself. Ask her doctors if she is a candidate for remdesivir -- not proved effective but sometimes available on a ""compassionate"" basis for severely ill patients. Good luck.

Observation from China Wuhan noted that patients with RA and on these medications had low incidence of COVID-19 infection. There is however no definite proof yet at this time.  In terms of whether you can stop methotrexate, you better discuss with your rheumatologist for the benefit and risk. .

","Safer to quarantine. Screening procedures to identify who has COVID-19 are not very reliable and vary depending on location (city, county, state, nation) and entity type (airline boarding, border control, clinic, school, etc.). Three months into the epidemic, the safest is to self-quarantine for 14-21 days upon arrival. Reliable test for virus is via nasal swab, but there's a shortage of test kits in most places.

"Is it true that if there was a lack of beds due to the virus, doctors would be less likely to save someone with diabetes, because they would be more likely to die??
","Brief opinion: Everything is in motion and medical decisions are fluid, so you won't know until it happens. That's because a healthy person under 50 won't die (has maybe half a percent chance of dying) from COVID-19, but a guy aged 70-80 has a 7-8% chance of dying from this... about the same as a non-elderly diabetic.

"When is it justified to isolate (not talking about the lock down) for COVID-19? Which symptoms justifies it?

"To help the community, should anyone returning from any country with cases of nCoV self-quarantine before returning to work?

If there are no people close by, and if the high-touch surfaces like table tops, keyboards, or doorknobs are clean, then one is a lot safer.

"At what temperature range (external temperature) will the COVID-19 virus be destroyed?  This in relation to (restaurants) cooking food and safety.  What does COVID stand for?
","Brief opinion: High temperature   COVID stands for 'COrona VIrus Diesase'.   We know that high temperature kills most pathogens eg protozoa, viruses and bacteria. That's why cooking is recommending for certain foods rather than eating it 'raw'. Temperatures of 140 to 160 degree F kills most pathogens including viruses. Corona viruses are sensitive to heat and cooking will destroy the outer protein layer and kill the virus.   Would you like to video or text chat with me?

"Can a cool mist vaporizer help with the Corona virus since it doesn’t like humidity?
","Not particularly. The facts are your nose & upper airway add humidity to the air you breathe to the point it reaches ~100% at the level of air exchange.

","Brief opinion: Likely nerve pain   this diagnosis would require a visit and imaging but the most likely cause is either pressure on a nerve in your neck or referred pain from the neck and shoulder with symptoms felt at the shoulder/shoulder blade.    Try to use the chlorzoxazone or an NSAID (ibuprofen or naproxen) or a combo of both and also try ice for pain, heat for stiffness or spasms.  It doesn't sound at all like COVID-19.

"
"Do you have any idea how long novel coronavirus stays on cash money?
","Uncertain. The exact amount of time would depend on the inoculum or how much virus was deposited and whether the cash were dry or moist . The limited studies suggest that the virus does not live very long on cardboard - about 4 hrs or so, so I suspect paper may be similar. If it were moist or wet, it may last longer. Heat may inactivate the virus, so consider setting the money in the sun or put in a drier.
"
"If I inhale enough Lysol, will it keep me from getting sick from novel coronavirus?

"Are viruses and bacterias live creatures?
","Yes, but... Bacteria are living creatures, like the rest of us. Viruses are missing some parts so are not living unless they are inside another living creature.

In a general sense, it is fine to think of viruses as living things, but technically speaking, they are not independently living when alone.

","Brief opinion: Antibiotic   I don't recommend antibiotics for a simple viral upper respiratory tract infection unless examination revealed signs of acute bronchitis or sinusitis.

"
"What is a novel coronavirus?
","A novel coronavirus is a new coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The virus causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), is not the same as the coronaviruses that commonly circulate among humans and cause mild illness, like the common cold.
"
"cool, thanks!
","No problem, stay safe and let us know if you come across anything else.
"
"Why is the disease being called covid-19?
","On February 11, 2020 the World Health Organization announced an official name for the disease that is causing the 2019 novel coronavirus outbreak, first identified in Wuhan China. The new name of this disease is coronavirus disease 2019, abbreviated as COVID-19. In COVID-19, ‘CO’ stands for ‘corona,’ ‘VI’ for ‘virus,’ and ‘D’ for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as “2019 novel coronavirus” or “2019-nCoV”. There are many types of human coronaviruses including some that commonly cause mild upper-respiratory tract illnesses. COVID-19 is a new disease, caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus that has not previously been seen in humans.
"
"Thx!
","No problem.
"
"How does the virus spread exactly?
","The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in many affected geographic areas. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.
"
"Thank you so much doctor.
","No problem, stay safe and let us know if you come across anything else. 
"
"Will warm weather stop the outbreak of covid-19?
","It is not yet known whether weather and temperature affect the spread of COVID-19. Some other viruses, like those that cause the common cold and flu, spread more during cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with these viruses during other months.  There is much more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.
"
"Can mosquitos or ticks spread the virus that causes covid-19?
","At this time, there are no solid data to support that this new coronavirus or other similar coronaviruses are spread by mosquitoes or ticks. The main way that COVID-19 spreads is from person to person.
"
"Thank you so much doc!
","No problem, let us know if you come across anything else. 
"
"Is it safe to get care for my other medical conditions during this time?
","Yes, it is important to continue taking care of your health and wellness. Continue your medications, and do not change your treatment plan without talking to your healthcare provider. Continue to manage your disease the way your healthcare provider has told you.
"
"Thanks a lot doctor. 
","No problem, let us know if you come across anything else. 
"
"Should I use soap and water or hand sanitizer to protect against COVID-19?
","Handwashing is one of the best ways to protect yourself and your family from getting sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol.

"Should contact lens wearers take special precautions to prevent covid-19?
","Currently there is no evidence to suggest contact lens wearers are more at risk for acquiring COVID-19 than eyeglass wearers.Contact lens wearers should continue to practice safe contact lens wear and care hygiene habits to help prevent against transmission of any contact lens-related infections, such as always washing hands with soap and water before handling lenses. People who are healthy can continue to wear and care for their contact lenses as prescribed by their eye care professional.

"What should I do if i get sick or someone in my house gets sick?
","Stay home when you are sick, except to get medical care. Use a separate room and bathroom for sick household members (if possible). Furthermore, wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing; going to the bathroom; and before eating or preparing food. Provide your sick household member with clean disposable facemasks to wear at home, if available, to help prevent spreading COVID-19 to others. Clean the sick room and bathroom, as needed, to avoid unnecessary contact with the sick person.

"
"Hi Doctor,
","Hi there, how can I help you today?
"
"I have a question. Who is at higher risk for serious illness from covid-19?
","COVID-19 is a new disease and there is limited information regarding risk factors for severe disease. Based on currently available information and clinical expertise, older adults and people with underlying medical conditions are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19
"
"What should people at higher risk of serious illness with covid-19 do?
","If you are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19, you should limit your interactions with other people as much as possible. If you decide to engage in public activities, continue to protect yourself by practicing everyday preventive actions. Keep these items on hand and use them when venturing out: a mask, tissues, and a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, if possible. Delay or cancel a visit if you or your visitors have symptoms of COVID-19 or have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 in the last 14 days. Anyone who has had close contact with a person with COVID-19 should stay home and monitor for symptoms.
"
"Okay, thanks alot.
","No problem, do you have any further questions?
"
"No, that's it. Thanks.
","Okay, stay safe!
"
"Hello
","Hi there
"
"Who is considered a close contract to someone with covid-19?
","For COVID-19, a close contact is anyone who was within 6 feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes. An infected person can spread COVID-19 starting 48 hours (or 2 days) before the person had any symptoms or tested positive for COVID-19.
"
"Am I still considered a close contact if I was wearing a mask?
","Yes, you are still considered a close contact even if you were wearing a mask while you were around someone with COVID-19. Masks are meant to protect other people in case you are infected, and not to protect you from becoming infected.
"
"If I am a close contact, will I be tested for covid-19?
","If you have been around someone who is sick with COVID-19, local authorities, the health department, or your doctor may recommend that you get tested for COVID-19. The health department may be able to provide resources for testing in your area. While you are waiting for your COVID-19 test result, stay home away from others (self-quarantine) and monitor your health for symptoms of COVID-19 to protect your friends, family, and others from possibly getting COVID-19.
"
"What do I do if I test positive?
","If your test is positive, you should continue to stay home and self-isolate away from others and monitor your health. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 and they worsen or become severe, you should seek emergency medical care. Severe symptoms include trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, or bluish lips or face.
"
"What if I test negative?
","If your test is negative and you don’t have symptoms, you should continue to stay home and self-quarantine away from others for 14 days after your last exposure to COVID-19 and follow all recommendations from the health department. This is important because symptoms can appear up to 14 days after you’ve been exposed and are infected. A negative result before the end of your quarantine period does not rule out possible infection. Additionally, you do not need a repeat test unless you develop symptoms, or if you require a test to return to work. If your test is negative and you have symptoms, you should continue to self-quarantine away from others for 14 days after your last exposure to COVID-19 and follow all recommendations from the health department. Additional medical consultation and a second test may be needed if your symptoms do not improve.
"
"Okay, thanks alot. I hope that never happens.
","No problem, do you have any further questions?
"
"No, that's it. Thanks.
","Okay, stay safe!
"
"Hello, I have a question to ask.
","Hi there, sure go ahead. 
"
"How does corona virus spread exactly? 
","Coronavirus usually spreads from an infected person's droplets. Droplets spread when a person coughs or sneezes.
"
"I see, thanks a lot.
","Is there anything else I can help today?
"
"No, that's it. Thanks!
","No problem!
"
"Hello, I have a question to ask you today.
","Hi there, sure go ahead. 
"
"Can I get sick from people who don't have symptoms?
","There have been instances of transmission before the person became sick or when a person's symptoms were so mild that they did not know they were sick. However, it is unclear if this contributes to significant spread of the virus in the population. Most people become ill from being in close contact with someone who shows symptoms such as coughing and sneezing, therefore transmitting the virus through droplets.
"
"I see, thanks a lot.
","Is there anything else I can help today?
"
"Yes, can you tell me if it's safe to handle cash and documents?
","The risk of COVID-19 transmission by cash and documents is low and is expected to be similar to other common surfaces such as doorknobs and handrails. It is safe to handle cash and documents. However, it would be advisable to wash your hands frequently, and always before eating, after using the washroom, and before touching your face. 
"
"Ah, okay thanks a lot.
","Is there anything else I can help today?
"
"No, that's it. Thanks a lot doctor.
","No problem! stay safe!
"
"Hello, I want to know if...
","Hi there, sure go ahead. 
"
"Air conditioner increase the chance of covid?
","The risk of spreading COVID-19 in enclosed air spaces is due to poor ventilation, rather than air conditioners. If the space is adequately ventilated with fresh air, the air conditioning becomes less of a risk factor. All mechanical heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems should be checked to ensure they are working properly. Use of portable air conditioners in unventilated spaces with doors and windows closed should be avoided. When using air conditioners and fans in ventilated spaces, air should be moved from higher places to lower places whenever possible instead of having strong airflow at breathing height.
"
"I see, that makes sense.
","Is there anything else I can help today?
"
"Yes, how long can these covid 19 virus survive? last on surface i mean. 
","The main way that COVID-19 is spread is from person-to-person. You may also be able to get COVID-19 from touching a surface that has the virus and then touching your face without washing your hands. The research shows that the virus lasts longer on smoother surfaces like plastic and glass compared to porous materials like cloth or paper. The virus may also last longer at lower temperatures, below 4 degrees C, compared to room temperature. This research used special techniques in laboratory settings to examine how long the virus can last, so the results of these studies may not reflect the behavior of the virus in everyday life.
"
"Ah, okay gotcha. 
","Is there anything else I can help today?
"
"Nope, that's it. Thanks a lot.
","No problem! stay safe!
"
"Hello, I have a quesition for you. What is physical distancing? Why do we even have to do these?
","Physical distancing is limiting close contact with other people to slow the spread of an infectious disease. An example of physical distancing is keeping about two meters (six feet) or the length of a queen-sized bed apart from others. Physical distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. 
"
"Yes, but I just don't like the idea of distancing. I'm not even sick though. 
","I understand. But even though we are not sick, we need to make changes to our everyday routines to stop the spread of germs between people. Stay home as much as possible, use technology to keep in touch with friends and family, and use food delivery services or online shopping. 
"
"Okay what about in public?
","In public, keep about two meters (six feet) or the length of a queen-sized bed apart when possible, keep your hands at your sides, and greet others with a wave instead of a handshake, a kiss or a hug. 
"
"Ah, okay gotcha. 
","Is there anything else I can help today?
"
"I don't think so. Thanks a lot.
","No problem! stay safe!
"
"Hello, I have a quesition for you. Is it safe to use public transit?
","If you must use public transit, regularly and thoroughly wash your hands and avoid touching your face with unwashed hands. Continue to distance yourself 2 metres (6 feet) away from others when possible. If this cannot be achieved, you may choose to wear a non-medical mask or cloth mask. Also if you can, try to use public transit at off peak times.
"
"What about going for shopping? Would it be safe?
","If you are sick, stay home! Do not go shopping, take public transit, go to work or go to school. Call 811 for health advice about how you are feeling and what to do next. Consider only shopping once per week for essential supplies and use food delivery services or online shopping where available. 
"
"Okay, thanks for your explanation. 
","Is there anything else I can help today?
"
"Not at the moment. 
","Okay stay safe!
"
"Hello, I have a quesition for you. 
","Sure. 
"
"Is there vaccine yet? when is this going to all end? 
","Unfortunately right now, there are no vaccines to prevent COVID-19. However, researchers are working hard to develop a vaccine.
"
"That really sucks. Will the flu vaccine help by any chance?
","No, influenza vaccines protect against viruses that cause influenza, often called the flu. The vaccine does not protect against other viruses or bacteria that cause common colds, stomach flu, or COVID-19. 
"
"Okay, seems like there are no good news. 
","Is there anything else I can help today?
"
"Yes, does home made masks work?
","A homemade mask or face covering can act as a barrier to help stop tiny droplets from your mouth and nose from entering the air and landing on other people or surfaces around you when you are talking, laughing, yelling, singing, coughing, or sneezing. Homemade masks can help to contain these droplets, but they work best if they have three layers and fit closely over your mouth, nose, cheeks and chin. Masks are less effective if the shape or the material has gaps in it because it will allow droplets to pass through.
"
"Okay so as long as i wear proper mask, i am safe?
","If you are sick you should stay home. Wearing a mask does not make it okay to go out, but it can help prevent the spread of germs at home if you cannot physically distance.
"
"Okay, what about home made sanitizers? would that work?
","No, Health Canada cautions that people should only use products that are on their approved or interim list of hand sanitizers. Serious problems such as burns, poisoning, lung problems and allergic reactions can occur if people use non-approved products. Non-approved products may not be effective against COVID-19 and give people a false sense of security. If you can't buy hand sanitizer, wash your hands! Washing your hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds is the most effective way to reduce the risk of spreading all germs, not just COVID-19. 
"
"Okay, thanks for your explanation. 
","Is there anything else I can help today?
"
"Not at the moment. Thanks for your help.
","No problem. Stay safe!
"
"Hello Doctor!
","Hi there, how can I help you today?
"
"How should I clean my mobile phone or electronics against covid?
","Mobile phones or other high touch electronics (keyboards, touch screens) are frequently handled items where germs can live and spread to others. Before cleaning or disinfecting your electronics, read the manufacturer's instructions to ensure there are no warnings or products that should not be used. You can clean your phone and other electronics by using disinfectant wipes or sprays with at least 70% alcohol at least daily. Dry your device thoroughly right after and never immerse it in any liquid.
"
"Okay, I see.
","Is there anything else I can help?
"
"yes, what are some of the symptoms of covid?
","The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to other respiratory illnesses including Influenza and the common cold. The most common symptoms include: Fever, chills cough or worsening cronic cough. You could also experience shortness of breath, sore throat, runny nose, loss of sense of smell or taste. Other commom symptoms include headache, fatigue diarrhea, and loss of appetite. 
"
"Wow. so many symptoms. What is the incubation period for covid?
","At this time, the available information suggests the incubation period is up to 14 days. The incubation period is the time from when a person is first exposed until symptoms appear.
"
"Okay. But I heard something called ibuprofen can help. Would it work for covid-19?
","There is no current evidence that ibuprofen makes COVID-19 worse or better. Ibuprofen is part of a group of medicines called NSAIDs and includes brand names like Advil and Motrin. If you take ibuprofen to treat another condition, you should continue taking it. To treat symptoms like fever, we recommend first using acetaminophen. If it isn’t available, you can use ibuprofen as an alternative.
"
"Okay, I appreciate your explanation!  
","Is there anything else I can help today?
"
"Not at the moment.
","Okay stay safe!
"
"Hello Doctor. I need your help. 
","Hi there, how can I help you today?
"
"What should I do if I think I have covid-19?
","If you develop cold, influenza or COVID-19-like symptoms, go to the bccdc testing page or use the BC COVID-19 Self-Assessment Tool to help determine if you need further assessment for COVID-19 testing by a physician, nurse practitioner or at a local collection centre. You can complete this assessment for yourself, or on behalf of someone else, if they are unable to. Unless a test is recommended by a medical health officer or a healthcare provider, an individual that has no symptoms, even if they are a contact of a confirmed case or a returning traveller, do not require a test.
"
"Gosh. Can I go to emergency department to get tested?
","Please avoid going to the emergency department for COVID-19 testing. Examples of reasons to go to an emergency department include if you or someone in your care has chest pains, difficulty breathing, or severe bleeding, as these may be signs of a life-threatening emergency. Call 9-1-1 or the local emergency number immediately. 
"
"I take care of my mother and she might have a mild condition. Should I get her tested?
","Yes. People who are vulnerable to COVID-19 complications should get tested if they develop symptoms, even if they are mild. Physicians and nurse practitioners may have a lower threshold for testing people who are more vulnerable to complications from COVID-19, or people who care for these individuals. 
"
"Would the test result come back faster depending on where I test it?
","The time until test results are available may vary depending on testing location. Throughout B.C., there are many labs running tests seven days a week to get test results back as soon as possible.
"
"What are antibodies?
","Antibodies help protect you from getting sick. They are proteins created by your immune system (i.e., the system that defends against infections) that float around your body and look for viruses or other pathogens that cause illness. When they find a virus, they attach to it and that signals to your body to destroy the virus before it has a chance to make you sick. Your body produces many types of antibodies but each kind will only attach to a specific virus. Your body has to be taught how to make the antibodies for each virus. It learns how to make antibodies by being exposed to the virus after getting sick, or by getting immunized. It may take up to 7 to 14 days for our body to make antibodies to a new infection.  
"
"Is there any anti-body test in BC?
","COVID-19 infection in the past. Because there is no vaccine yet available for COVID-19, the only way a person can develop antibodies is from being previously infected. This type of test is less useful for diagnosing current infection because it can take weeks for your body to make enough antibodies to be detected through antibody testing. B.C. is beginning to use antibody testing in very few clinical situations. Antibody testing can also be used at the direction Medical Health Officers as part of a public health investigation or for epidemiologic research studies. COVID-19 is a new illness so there is not enough information yet to know how long or if at all, a person will be immune if they’ve previously been infected and developed antibodies. Research studies in B.C. and Canada are trying to understand whether people with antibodies to COVID-19 can get COVID-19 again. They are also looking at how many people have been infected with COVID-19 in British Columbia.
"
"Okay, I appreciate your help!
","Is there anything else I can help today?
"
"Not at the moment.
","Okay stay safe!
"
"Hello Doctor. I have a question for you. Should I still get my baby or child immunized during COVID-19?
","Yes, it is important to keep immunizations up to date.Immunization is an essential service and health units are continuing to hold clinics during COVID-19. However, services may vary. Clinic changes have been made to ensure safety. Visit ImmunizeBC for the latest information on immunization during COVID-19.
"
"Okay, but why are all the events being cancelled?
","At this time, event organizers are ordered to limit all public gatherings larger than 50 people. The May 22 Order of the Provincial Health Officer includes indoor and outdoor sporting events, conferences, meetings, religious gatherings, drive-ins or other similar events.

NAME: Brant goose,"Thanks for your concern. The dry cough basically has a few causes....First is Post nasal drip, second  Gastroesophageal reflux'heart burn', third Cough variant aasthma, forth Heart failure and finally Interstitial lung disease. Based on the information if you don't have a heart burn or reflux of food or sour brash into your mouth, you are having a cough variant asthma, make sure you do not have difficulty breathing. There is something called cardiac asthma, but it's not much of a likelihood given your young age.I advice you that you give up on smoking as it causes a multitude of problems and may well be related to the cough you've been having now called as 'smokers cough'.It's time that you stop smoking, avoid animal dancers, mites, pollens and any thing that would exacerbate the illness, make sure you don't have a heart burn, and if still the cough persists , meet a pulmo neologism and get a Pulmonary function test with methacholine challenge

Considering you have had TB in the past there are many possibilities for your present episodes of hemoptysis.  It could me a bacterial infection or relapse of TB or post TB bronchiectasis (abnormal permanent dilation of your airways at few places which happens when they get damaged due to your past TB). Take a course of antibiotic as prescribed by your physician ,Consult with your physician  and discuss about taking drugs like tranexemic acid which reduce the bleeding tendency , cough suppressants . while sleeping, Lie on the side which was previously affected by TB and be on complete bed rest . Once your hemoptysis gets controlled go for sputum examination to check for TB bacilli , chest x ray and if needed HRCT thorax (to pick up bronchiectasis which can sometimes be not evident on x ray). Since u mentioned severe back pain , vascular abnormalities concerning  the descending aorta (the major blood vessel carrying blood from the heart)needs to be also considered  Treatment is to be decided based on the cause for your hemoptysis.Do review with your physician and get the necessary investigations done.

my cousin german was admitted yesterday for pneumonia and a collasped lung which was diagnoised yesterday. they did surgery this morning by cleaning out and draining fluid. she is now heavily sadated with a tube in her correct lung. what will it take for her to get well again?,"It sound like your cousin has something called- Empyema. It is basically an abscess in the chest cavity. And the correct treatment for it is drainage - which was done appropriatley. But he should receive antibiotic treatment with coverage of both aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Usually specimens are send from the procedure to see which organisms grow and provide a more directed antibiotic coverage.

my mother was diagnosed with left basal pneumonia she is seventy four yeas old and was discharged from hospital yesterday was given augmentin and clarithromycin but now she constitute be sick and has diarohhea she has had amoxicillin before which hasnt effected her this way will it be the early antibiotics also what is left basal pneumonia,"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, her diarrhoea is mostly due to amoxicillin. Amoxicillin can cause diarrhea on second exposure. So you should stop amoxicillin. There are options for oral antibiotics other than amoxicillin like cefixime, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin etc. And left basal pneumonia means lung infection in lower lobe of left lung. So antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your mother.Thanks.

"What is the advisability of exercise in the year following treatment with Levofloxaxin for pneumonia? I just completed 5 days of treatment with pills after 4 or more days of IV in the hospital following gall bladder surgery. I entered the hospital with pneumonia (not knowing I had it ), probably having contracted it from my brother who had it and whom I had visited several sidereal day earlier in another hospital. I am 71 years old, female; I had a non - heart damaging heart attempt in 2003 and have tried to asseverate a good exercise program to lessen my chances of worsening heart disease. Should 1 re start Naproxen for joint / muscle pain; had 2 doses (2 pad of paper twice day by day) 2 days before hospitalization. Did not need it the 3rd 24 hour interval and personify hospitalized the next day. Did not take it post hospitalization. Do not remember if they gave it in hospital; think not. Thank you.","Hello welcome to HCM. I have gone through your history. You have been adequately treated for your pneumonia and I suppose you don't have any symptoms of pneumonia like cough, fast breathing, fever, breathlessness. Since you have received intravenous plus 5 days of oral antibiotics, now you can resume about your exercise regime. As you say you had a non damaging heart attack, means that your heart pumping function is well preserved. So you must not have any issues with exercise. With every lung infection the lung capacity decreases by some percentage proportional to he severity of the infection. Hence along with your routine exercises you must also undergo breathing exercises with incentive spirometry, inhaling deeply through one nose holding your breath and exhaling fully from the other nose, meditation and yoga. This will help you to regain some of the lost lung capacity. You should also get vaccinated with influenza and pneumonia vaccines that include common strains which cause pneumonia Remember they don't protect you against all pneumonias but offer protection against common pneumonias.Regarding Naproxen too much of it may cause damage to your kidneys so I advice you decrease its usage and use it only when required rather than a daily basis.Wishing you good health. Regards

If the space is adequately ventilated with fresh air, the air conditioning becomes less of a risk factor. All mechanical heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems should be checked to ensure they are working properly. Use of portable air conditioners in unventilated spaces with doors and windows closed should be avoided. When using air conditioners and fans in ventilated spaces, air should be moved from higher places to lower places whenever possible instead of having strong airflow at breathing height.

"Yes, how long can these covid xix virus survive? final on airfoil 1 mean.","The main way that COVID-19 is spread is from person-to-person. You may also be able to get COVID-19 from touching a surface that has the virus and then touching your face without washing your hands. The research shows that the virus lasts longer on smoother surfaces like plastic and glass compared to porous materials like cloth or paper. The virus may also last longer at lower temperatures, below 4 degrees C, compared to room temperature. This research used special techniques in laboratory settings to examine how long the virus can last, so the results of these studies may not reflect the behavior of the virus in everyday life.

Homemade masks can help to contain these droplets, but they work best if they have three layers and fit closely over your mouth, nose, cheeks and chin. Masks are less effective if the shape or the material has gaps in it because it will allow droplets to pass through.

What should Ane do if One reckon I have covid - 19?,"If you develop cold, influenza or COVID-19-like symptoms, go to the bccdc testing page or use the BC COVID-19 Self-Assessment Tool to help determine if you need further assessment for COVID-19 testing by a physician, nurse practitioner or at a local collection centre. You can complete this assessment for yourself, or on behalf of someone else, if they are unable to. Unless a test is recommended by a medical health officer or a healthcare provider, an individual that has no symptoms, even if they are a contact of a confirmed case or a returning traveller, do not require a test.

What are antibodies?,"Antibodies help protect you from getting sick. They are proteins created by your immune system (i.e., the system that defends against infections) that float around your body and look for viruses or other pathogens that cause illness. When they find a virus, they attach to it and that signals to your body to destroy the virus before it has a chance to make you sick. Your body produces many types of antibodies but each kind will only attach to a specific virus. Your body has to be taught how to make the antibodies for each virus. It learns how to make antibodies by being exposed to the virus after getting sick, or by getting immunized. It may take up to 7 to 14 days for our body to make antibodies to a new infection.  
"
Is on that point any anti - body test in BC?,"COVID-19 infection in the past. Because there is no vaccine yet available for COVID-19, the only way a person can develop antibodies is from being previously infected. This type of test is less useful for diagnosing current infection because it can take weeks for your body to make enough antibodies to be detected through antibody testing. B.C. is beginning to use antibody testing in very few clinical situations. Antibody testing can also be used at the direction Medical Health Officers as part of a public health investigation or for epidemiologic research studies. COVID-19 is a new illness so there is not enough information yet to know how long or if at all, a person will be immune if they’ve previously been infected and developed antibodies. Research studies in B.C. and Canada are trying to understand whether people with antibodies to COVID-19 can get COVID-19 again. They are also looking at how many people have been infected with COVID-19 in British Columbia.

Second-hand smoking is also a contributing factor to your pneumonia.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Kaushal Bhavsar

NAME: arises Brent,"Thanks for your concern. The dry cough basically has a few causes....First is Post nasal drip, second  Gastroesophageal reflux'heart burn', third Cough variant aasthma, forth Heart failure and finally Interstitial lung disease. Based on the information if you don't have a heart burn or reflux of food or sour brash into your mouth, you are having a cough variant asthma, make sure you do not have difficulty breathing. There is something called cardiac asthma, but it's not much of a likelihood given your young age.I advice you that you give up on smoking as it causes a multitude of problems and may well be related to the cough you've been having now called as 'smokers cough'.It's time that you stop smoking, avoid animal dancers, mites, pollens and any thing that would exacerbate the illness, make sure you don't have a heart burn, and if still the cough persists , meet a pulmo neologism and get a Pulmonary function test with methacholine challenge

Considering you have had TB in the past there are many possibilities for your present episodes of hemoptysis.  It could me a bacterial infection or relapse of TB or post TB bronchiectasis (abnormal permanent dilation of your airways at few places which happens when they get damaged due to your past TB). Take a course of antibiotic as prescribed by your physician ,Consult with your physician  and discuss about taking drugs like tranexemic acid which reduce the bleeding tendency , cough suppressants . while sleeping, Lie on the side which was previously affected by TB and be on complete bed rest . Once your hemoptysis gets controlled go for sputum examination to check for TB bacilli , chest x ray and if needed HRCT thorax (to pick up bronchiectasis which can sometimes be not evident on x ray). Since u mentioned severe back pain , vascular abnormalities concerning  the descending aorta (the major blood vessel carrying blood from the heart)needs to be also considered  Treatment is to be decided based on the cause for your hemoptysis.Do review with your physician and get the necessary investigations done.

Did not need it the 3rd day and was hospitalized the next day. Did not take it post hospitalization. Do not remember lossmaking if Dangle they gave it in hospital; think not. Thank you.","Hello welcome to HCM. I have gone through your history. You have been adequately treated for your pneumonia and I suppose you don't have any symptoms of pneumonia like cough, fast breathing, fever, breathlessness. Since you have received intravenous plus 5 days of oral antibiotics, now you can resume about your exercise regime. As you say you had a non damaging heart attack, means that your heart pumping function is well preserved. So you must not have any issues with exercise. With every lung infection the lung capacity decreases by some percentage proportional to he severity of the infection. Hence along with your routine exercises you must also undergo breathing exercises with incentive spirometry, inhaling deeply through one nose holding your breath and exhaling fully from the other nose, meditation and yoga. This will help you to regain some of the lost lung capacity. You should also get vaccinated with influenza and pneumonia vaccines that include common strains which cause pneumonia Remember they don't protect you against all pneumonias but offer protection against common pneumonias.Regarding Naproxen too much of it may cause damage to your kidneys so I advice you decrease its usage and use it only when required rather than a daily basis.Wishing you good health.

How does Sacramentorum the virus spread Moneymaker exactly?,"The virus that causes COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. Spread is more likely when people are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet). COVID-19 seems to be spreading easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in many affected geographic areas. Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.

Air conditioner increase the suspended chance of Lavonne covid?,"The risk of spreading COVID-19 in enclosed air spaces is due to poor ventilation, rather than air conditioners. If the space is adequately ventilated with fresh air, the air conditioning becomes less of a risk factor. All mechanical heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems should be checked to ensure they are working properly. Use of portable air conditioners in unventilated spaces with doors and windows closed should be avoided. When using air conditioners and fans in ventilated spaces, air should be moved from higher places to lower places whenever possible instead of having strong airflow at breathing height.

Your body produces many types of antibodies but each kind will only attach to a specific virus. Your body has to be taught how to make the antibodies for each virus. It learns how to make antibodies by being exposed to the virus after getting sick, or by getting immunized. It may take up to 7 to 14 days for our body to make antibodies to a new infection.

Because there is no vaccine yet available for COVID-19, the only way a person can develop antibodies is from being previously infected.

B.C. is beginning to use antibody testing in very few clinical situations. Antibody testing can also be used at the direction Medical Health Officers as part of a public health investigation or for epidemiologic research studies. COVID-19 is a new illness so there is not enough information yet to know how long or if at all, a person will be immune if they’ve previously been infected and developed antibodies. Research studies in B.C. and Canada are trying to understand whether people with antibodies to COVID-19 can get COVID-19 again. They are also looking at how many people have been infected with COVID-19 in British Columbia.
